    <!-- CONTEXT -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Business Context & Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Bubble Bros Cleaning launched as a new local competitor in Jersey City, NJ, offering three core services:
        Regular Clean, Deep Clean, and Move In/Move Out Clean. The customer problem wasn’t complexity—it was time and desire:
        people were too busy to clean or simply didn’t want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Bubble Bros was new, the initial objective focused on establishing brand awareness and trust before pushing hard on sales:
        show up professionally, communicate clearly, and earn credibility—then convert that attention into leads.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- INSIGHT -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Strategic Insight</h2>
      <p>
        A competitor audit across Google presence, local rankings, and social activity revealed a consistent pattern:
        many local competitors were visually generic and inconsistent in their messaging. That created an opening to win by being clearer,
        more credible, and more discoverable—especially where demand already existed.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we won by tightening positioning, improving discoverability, and making the booking path frictionless.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GTM -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The strategy prioritized demand capture (high intent) over broad awareness buys. We focused on Google and Facebook because local
        service customers search with urgency and proximity—and competitors were leaving gaps in their profiles, messaging, and conversion paths.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Google:</strong> Search intent + Business Profile optimization for discovery and trust</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Local awareness + social proof + inbound lead capture</li>
        <li><strong>Messaging:</strong> Convenience and relief (downtime regained), not just “a clean home”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- EXECUTION -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Execution</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Website & funnels:</strong> Service clarity (Regular/Deep/Move) with straightforward CTA paths</li>
        <li><strong>Offer packaging:</strong> Structured services to match buyer intent and reduce decision friction</li>
        <li><strong>Google Profile:</strong> Optimized for local discovery, professionalism, and credibility signals</li>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Organic messaging designed to build trust and familiarity before hard selling</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- CONSTRAINTS (HIGH SIGNAL) -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>New market entrant competing against established local providers</li>
        <li>Trust-building required before heavy offer promotion</li>
        <li>Local visibility needed quickly to generate early lead volume</li>
      </ul>

        The biggest validation was demand: we identified a real market opening and exceeded original expectations,
        generating enough inbound interest to confirm both channel strategy and positioning.
