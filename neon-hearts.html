    <!-- CONTEXT -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Business Context & Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Neon Hearts is a nonprofit in the NYC metropolitan area providing financial and career readiness services to underserved communities.
        The organization supports two primary audiences: urban youth (ages 17–24) and marginalized BIPOC adults (ages 25–55).
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Urban youth (17–24):</strong> career readiness programs—from choosing a field of study to evaluating careers aligned with earning goals</li>
        <li><strong>BIPOC adults (25–55):</strong> “adulting” financial advisement—first home, retirement planning, and navigating corporate careers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The initial goal was brand awareness and community audience growth—building trust first, then expanding distribution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- INSIGHT -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Strategic Insight</h2>
      <p>
        This wasn’t a traditional “sell a product” problem. The primary challenge was trust and resonance: identifying where the message landed,
        which audience responded first, and which channels supported credibility and community—not just reach.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GTM -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        We selected Instagram and Facebook as primary channels based on audience fit and community behavior—where both youth and adults already
        spent time and where trust could be built through consistent education and founder-led credibility.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Channels:</strong> Instagram + Facebook (TikTok secondary)</li>
        <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> supportive guidance and “hand-holding” through financial/career decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Content focus:</strong> educational value, empathy, and real-life relevance over hype</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- EXECUTION -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Execution</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Brand & messaging:</strong> clarified value proposition and wrote copy designed to feel human, grounded, and trustworthy</li>
        <li><strong>Web/funnel assets:</strong> landing pages built for clarity and frictionless inquiries</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> organic posting on brand + founder pages to build credibility and spark collaboration</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- CONSTRAINTS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Mission-driven organization where trust mattered more than hard conversion</li>
        <li>Multiple demographics requiring careful positioning and channel selection</li>
        <li>Early-stage growth focused on community and partnerships rather than paid scale</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- OUTCOMES -->
    <section class="case-section" id="outcomes">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Measured via inbound collaboration interest and early community traction during the initial awareness push.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posting consistently through the brand and founder’s Facebook presence generated an influx of interest from local vendors and schools
        looking to collaborate—creating a powerful non-obvious channel for growth: partnerships with local schools across the NYC area.
      </p>
      <p>
        This expanded the GTM beyond social distribution and opened the door to institutional reach—helping Neon Hearts grow credibility and expand impact.
